**Task 2 – Automated Report Generation**

In Task 2 of my CODTECH Python internship, I was required to design and implement a Python script that could read data from a file, analyze it, and generate a well-formatted PDF report automatically. This task simulated real-world business workflows where repetitive reporting processes can be automated to save time, reduce human error, and ensure consistent formatting.

The project began with **Data Input and Reading**. I worked with data stored in CSV and text file formats, using Python’s built-in file handling functions and the **Pandas** library for structured data processing. Pandas allowed me to load datasets quickly, handle large amounts of information, and perform data transformations with minimal code.

Once the data was read, I moved to the **Data Analysis** phase. This step involved cleaning the dataset by removing missing or invalid entries, converting data types where necessary, and calculating meaningful statistics. For example, if the file contained sales data, I calculated totals, averages, percentage changes, and identified trends or anomalies. I also grouped and sorted the data to make it more meaningful for the final report.

The core of the task was **Automated PDF Report Generation**. For this, I used two major Python libraries—**FPDF** and **ReportLab**.

* **FPDF** allowed me to generate simple PDFs with custom fonts, headers, and page layouts.
* **ReportLab** offered more advanced features such as creating tables, embedding charts, and controlling precise positioning of text and images.

Using these tools, I designed a professional-looking report that included:

1. **Title Page** – Displaying the report name, date, and company/internship details.
2. **Summary Section** – Providing an overview of the dataset and key insights.
3. **Data Tables** – Clearly presenting important statistics in tabular form.
4. **Charts and Graphs** – Created using **Matplotlib**, embedded into the PDF to visually communicate trends.

The report generation process was fully automated—once the script was executed, it would read the latest file, perform the analysis, generate charts, and produce a polished PDF without manual intervention.

I also implemented **Error Handling** to ensure the script could handle missing files, incorrect formats, or unexpected data without crashing. Informative error messages were displayed to guide the user in fixing the issue.

**Tools and Technologies Used:**

* **Python** – core programming language.
* **Pandas** – for reading and processing data.
* **Matplotlib** – for creating charts to embed in the PDF.
* **FPDF** & **ReportLab** – for generating the PDF report.
* **OS Module** – for handling file paths and saving reports to specific locations.
* **Development Environment** - Visual studio code
